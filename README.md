# Voxfield: non-Projective Signed Distance Fields for Online Planning and 3D Reconstruction

This repository implements Voxfield, an improved version of the volumetric mapping framework [**Voxblox**](https://github.com/ethz-asl/voxblox) on both the mapping accuracy and efficiency. 
It is based on the original [**Voxblox**](https://github.com/ethz-asl/voxblox) implementation, with the additional capacity of a non-projective TSDF integration and an efficient ESDF integration based on TSDF map.
Voxfield has also been integrated into a multi-resolution panoptic mapping framework [**Panmap**](https://github.com/VIS4ROB-lab/voxfield-panmap) for high-fidelity large-scale semantic reconstruction.

## Paper and Video (TBA)

## Installation
To install Voxfield, follow these [instructions](). 

## Instructions
- To run the non-projective TSDF mapping and ESDF mapping of Voxfield, use the executables: ```np_tsdf_server``` and ```voxfield_server```. 
- To run the original TSDF mapping and ESDF mapping of Voxblox, use the executables: ```tsdf_server``` and ```voxblox_server```. 
- To run the ESDF mapping of FIESTA, use the executables: ```fiesta_server```.
- To run the ESDF mapping of EDT, use the executables: ```voxedt_server```.

## Example Usage
### Run on the Cow & Lady dataset


### Run on the KITTI dataset
