# Voxfield: non-Projective Signed Distance Fields for Online Planning and 3D Reconstruction

This repository implements Voxfield, an overall improved version of the volumetric mapping framework [Voxblox](https://github.com/ethz-asl/voxblox) on both the accuracy and efficiency. 
Voxfield has also been integrated into a multi-resolution panoptic mapping framework [Panmap](https://github.com/YuePanEdward/panoptic_mapping) for high-fidelity large-scale semantic reconstruction.
